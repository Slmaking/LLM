# Project Title: Large Language Model

## Overview

This project leverages the GPT-2, a state-of-the-art text generation model, in conjunction with a Location-based Learning Model (LLM) to [briefly describe what the project does]. GPT-2 is utilized for [describe functionality], while LLM is used to [describe functionality].

## Models Overview

### GPT-2

GPT-2, developed by OpenAI, is a large-scale unsupervised language model which can generate coherent paragraphs of text. It excels at a range of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including text generation, summarization, and translation, among others.

### Location-based Learning Model (LLM)

[Provide a brief overview of LLM, its functionality, and how it is utilized in the project. If LLM refers to something different, please provide details.]

## Installation and Setup
